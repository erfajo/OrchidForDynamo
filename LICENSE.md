The geographical and behavioral limitation applied in this work implies if you are either Danish or located in Denmark, you need to be registered to be able to obtain a license. However, not everyone will be able to obtain a license if a scenario exists where a professional work-related conflict of interest may arise with the author. Such a case may be in the geographical vicinity (Denmark), where the author acts professionally and must live off the intellectual property rights in the form of job security/consultancy. It will also be seen as a conflict of interest if the author experiences personal bothering or other harassment from any user or company. In case of conflict of interest, no license will be granted to the Orchid solution for the user/company.
