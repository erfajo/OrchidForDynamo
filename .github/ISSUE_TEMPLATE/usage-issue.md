### How to get help...
I will try to assist you as best as possible. One way to do that is by answering your questions. But to get the right answer, you’ll first have to ask your question in the right way. Although I will try my best, there are things you can do to improve your chances of getting good and quick answers. Below you will find some suggestions on how to achieve that. Do not think of these suggestions as rules and especially do not take them as a guarantee of getting an answer.

1. Choose a descriptive title for your post
2. Be succinct but clear in your wording
3. Attach minimal versions of all the relevant files
4. Include a detailed image or sketch if it makes sense
5. Include links to online resources if possible
6. Create new topics rather than continuing old ones
7. This is not a ‘do my work for me’ assistance
8. Search is your friend, try first to see if your issue is handled in the samples
9. If your problem has been solved, mark the post as solved.
